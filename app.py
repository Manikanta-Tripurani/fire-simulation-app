    Uncontrolled forest fires represent a significant challenge for government agencies tasked with preserving biodiversity and maintaining air quality. The spread of such fires is influenced by factors including weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind), terrain (slope, aspect, fuel availability), and human activity. With modern geospatial technologies, datasets from the Forest Survey of India and global services like VIIRS-SNP are accessible. Despite this, real-time simulation and forecasting remain complex. Short-term forecasting and dynamic simulation are crucial for timely preventive measures. AI/ML techniques offer promising capabilities to extract insights, helping planners estimate damage, prioritize containment, and mitigate fire impacts.

    st.markdown("""
    Our project tackles this challenge with a comprehensive two-stage AI pipeline, designed for practical use by planning authorities:
    1.  *AI-Powered Prediction:* We utilize a *Random Forest classification model* to analyze a feature stack of geospatial data. This model predicts the probability of a fire starting in any given 30m x 30m area, creating a detailed "Next-Day Fire Risk Map".
    2.  *Dynamic Simulation:* We then use a *Cellular Automata model* to simulate the spread of a fire. This model is initialized at the highest-risk location identified by our AI and dynamically incorporates environmental factors like terrain and user-defined weather conditions (wind speed and direction) to produce a realistic spread animation.

    st.subheader("Data Sources & Pre-processing")
    st.markdown("""
    *   *Terrain Parameters:* Slope and Aspect were derived from a 30m resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) sourced from the *Bhoonidhi Portal*.
    *   *Fuel Availability:* Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps from *Bhuvan* were used to determine the type and availability of fire fuel.
    *   *Historical Fire Data:* Fire event locations from *VIIRS-SNP* were used as the ground truth (target variable) for training our prediction model.
    *   *Preprocessing:* All datasets were resampled to a uniform 30m resolution and stacked to create the feature set for our model.
    """)

    st.subheader("Methodology & Tools")
    st.markdown("""
    *   *Prediction Model:* We chose a *Random Forest* for its high accuracy on tabular geospatial data and its robustness against overfitting, which is critical for reliable predictions.
    *   *Simulation Model:* A *Cellular Automata* was chosen for its efficiency and its ability to model complex emergent behavior (like fire spread) from simple, local rules.
    *   *Technology Stack:* The entire project was built in *Python*, using libraries such as Scikit-learn, Rasterio, NumPy, and Streamlit for the interactive web application.
